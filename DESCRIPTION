Description: This package is a statistical method for detecting differentially expressed proteins for label-free quantification MS-based single-cell proteomics data. pepDESC also applies to regular proteomics data. The method simply use the peptide quantification result generated by serach engines as the input data. The  result is quantified by DE-scores.
